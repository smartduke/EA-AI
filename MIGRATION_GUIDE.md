# ✅ Migration from NextAuth to Supabase - COMPLETED

This migration has been successfully completed! The application has been migrated from NextAuth to Supabase authentication.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Database Migration
- ✅ Removed custom `User` table (replaced by Supabase's `auth.users`)
- ✅ Removed deprecated `Message_v2` and `Vote_v2` tables
- ✅ Updated all `userId` foreign keys to reference Supabase's `auth.users.id` directly
- ✅ Updated `Stream` table to reference `userId` instead of `chatId`
- ✅ Simplified `Document` table structure

### Code Changes
- ✅ Replaced NextAuth dependencies with Supabase
- ✅ Updated authentication logic in login/register pages
- ✅ Updated middleware for Supabase session handling
- ✅ Updated all chat pages and layouts
- ✅ Created session adapter for type compatibility
- ✅ Updated user navigation component

## Next Steps for Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. Supabase Auth Setup
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > Settings
2. Configure your site URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for development)
3. Add your production URL when deploying
4. Configure email templates if needed

### 4. Test the Application
The development server should be running. Test:
1. Navigate to `/register` to create a new account
2. Check your email for verification (if email verification is enabled)
3. Try logging in at `/login`
4. Test protected routes

## Key Features Now Available

✅ **Email/Password Authentication**
✅ **Email Verification** (configurable in Supabase)
✅ **Password Reset** (configurable in Supabase)
✅ **Session Management**
✅ **Server-side Authentication**
✅ **Client-side Authentication**
✅ **Middleware Protection**
✅ **Secure User Data Storage**

## Authentication Flow

### Current (Supabase)
- Supabase manages users and authentication
- Built-in email verification
- Session management via Supabase
- More secure and feature-rich
- No custom password hashing needed

## Production Deployment

1. Set environment variables in your hosting provider
2. Update Supabase site URL to your production domain
3. Configure email templates for your domain
4. Test authentication flow in production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Environment Variables Not Found**
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

**Email Verification Not Working**
- Check Supabase Auth settings
- Verify site URL is correct
- Check spam folder for verification emails

**Session Not Persisting**
- Clear browser storage
- Check if cookies are being blocked
- Verify middleware configuration

**"User already registered" Error**
- This is expected behavior - Supabase prevents duplicate accounts
- User should use "Sign In" instead or reset their password

## Migration Notes

- ⚠️ **Important**: Any existing user data from the old `User` table has been removed. Users will need to create new accounts.
- The database schema has been updated to work with Supabase's user management system.
- All foreign key references now point to Supabase's `auth.users` table.
- Stream and document data structure has been updated for better performance.
